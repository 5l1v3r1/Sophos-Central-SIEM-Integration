### Installation ###

Download and extract from the following link
Script requires Python 2.7.9+ to run. Its not supported on Python 3.x.

### Configuration ###

SIEM script gets last 12 hours of events by default. Maximum 24 hours of historical data can be retrieved. Script keeps tab of its state,â€‚it will always pick-up from where it left off based on a state file stored in state folder. Script calls the server until there are no more events available. There is also a built-in retry mechanism if there are any network issues. Script exits if there are no more events available or when retry fails. In this case next scheduled run of the script will pick-up cursor from the last run using the state file.

Set SOPHOS_SIEM_HOME environment variable to point to the folder where config.ini, siem_cef_mapping.txt, state and log folders will be located. state and log folders are created when the script is run for the first time.

config.ini is a configuration file that exists by default in the siem-scripts folder.

Here are the steps to configure siem script:
1) Open config.ini in a text editor.
2) Under 'API Access URL + Headers' in the config file, copy and paste the API Access URL + Headers block from the Api Token Management page in Sophos Central.
3) Under json, cef or keyvalue, you could choose the preferred output of the response i.e. json, cef or keyvalue.
4) Under filename, you can specify the filename that your output would be saved to. Options are syslog, stdout or any custom file name. Custom files are created in a folder named log.
5) If you are using syslog then under syslog properties in the config file, configure address, facility and socktype.


### Running the script

Run 'python siem.py' and you should see the results as specified in the config file.
For more options and help on running the script run 'python siem.py -h'
